# surfs_up
Using VS Code, SQLite, Python, Flask


## Module
In this module, we used SQLite, Python, and Flask to manipualte data about Hawaii weather patterns to 
inform investors about their potential investment in a surf shop on Oahu.

## Challenge
The goals of this challenge are to:

Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.

## Data and Recommendations
In June, the average precipitation is .13, and the average temperature is 74.9 degrees F. 
In December, the average precipitation is .22 and the average temperature is 71.04 degrees F. 
December gets more rainfall and is slightly cooler, but the weather is temperature in both months. 
For further analysis, I would try to find the times of the year where you predit business to be booming (May- August) and see how the weather generally is then. This would give investors a good sense of how much money the surf shop could foreshadow making. The other recommendation I would have is to see what months of the year are the "rainy season". Sometimes, especially in tropical places, the rainy season is not necessarily in December. This would let investors know what time of year the surf shop could expect business to be down.
